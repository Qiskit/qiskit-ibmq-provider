## [UNRELEASED]

### Added
- `QueueInfo` (returned by `IBMQJob.queue_info()`) now has a new method: 
  `format()`. The method returns a formatted string of the queue information.
  (\#515)
- `IBMQJob` now has three new methods: `done()`, `running()`, and
  `cancelled()`. The methods are used to indicate the job status. (\#494)  
- `backend.run()` now accepts an optional `job_tags` parameter. If
  specified, the `job_tags` are assigned to the job, which can also be used
  as a filter in `backend.jobs()`. (\#511)
- `IBMQBackend` now has two new methods: `job_limit()` and 
  `remaining_job_counts()`. `job_limit()` returns the job limit for a 
  backend, which includes the current number of active jobs you have on 
  the backend and the the maximum number of active jobs you can have on 
  it. `remaining_job_counts()` returns the number of remaining jobs that 
  could be submitted to the backend before the maximum limit on active
  jobs is reached. Note the job limit for a backend is given for a specific 
  provider (i.e. a specific backend with a specific provider). (\#513)
- `IBMQJobManager` now has a new method `retrieve_job_set()` that allows
  you to retrieve a previously submitted job set using the job set ID.
  A job set ID can be retrieved using the new `job_set.job_set_id()` 
  method. (\#514)

### Changed

- The Exception hierarchy has been refined with more specialized classes. 
  You can, however, continue to catch their parent exceptions (such 
  as `IBMQAccountError`). Also, the exception class `IBMQApiUrlError` 
  has been replaced by `IBMQAccountCredentialsInvalidUrl` and 
  `IBMQAccountCredentialsInvalidToken`. (\#480)

## [0.4.5] - 2019-12-18

### Added

- `IBMQJob` now has a new `queue_info()` method that returns queue 
  information, such as queue position, estimated start/end time, and 
  priority levels for the job. (\#467)  
- Python 3.8 is now supported in qiskit-ibmq-provider. (\#445)

## [0.4.4] - 2019-12-09

### Added

- `IBMQJob.result()` now accepts an optional `refresh` parameter. If 
  `refresh=True` is specified, the function re-queries the api for the 
  results, rather than returning those cached. (\#469)
- `POST` network request are now retried if the status code is among specific
  safe codes. In the case of the request failing during job submission, more
  information is now displayed in the `INFO` and `DEBUG` log levels. (\#475)

### Deprecated

- Python 3.5 support in qiskit-ibmq-provider is deprecated. Support will be
  removed on the upstream python community's end of life date for the version,
  which is 09/13/2020.  (\#445)
  

## [0.4.3] - 2019-11-21

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `IBMQJob.error_message()` may raise an exception
  if the job fails before execution. (\#458)

## [0.4.2] - 2019-11-18

### Fixed

- Fixed `IBMQBackendService.jobs()` to correctly return jobs when
  both `start_datetime` and `end_datetime` are specified. Now, when the 
  two parameters are specified, the function will return the jobs after 
  (greater than or equal to) and before (less than or equal to) the 
  two given datetimes. (\#452)

## [0.4.1] - 2019-11-14

### Fixed

- Fixed `job.creation_date()` return string format to be the same as that of 
  release 0.3. (\#447)

### Changed

- `IBMBackend.jobs()` and `IBMQBackendService.jobs()` now accept the 
  optional parameters `start_datetime` and `end_datetime`. If one is 
  specified, it is used to find jobs whose creation date is after 
  (greater than) or before (less than) the given the date/time, 
  respectively. If both are specified, they are used to find jobs 
  whose creation date is between the two dates. (\#443)

## [0.4.0] - 2019-11-12

### Added

- A new `IBMQJobManager` class that takes a list of circuits or pulse schedules
  as input, splits them into one or more jobs, and submits the jobs.
  (\#389, \#400, \#407)
- New features to `provider.backends`:
  - it contains the available backends as attributes. A user can now use
    `provider.backends.<tab>` to see a list of backend names, and make
     use of the attributes as regular `IBMQBackend` instances. (\#303)
  - the methods `provider.backends.jobs()` and
    `provider.backends.retrieve_job()` can be used for retrieving
    provider-wide jobs. (\#354)

### Changed

- `IBMQBackend.run()` now accepts an optional `job_name` parameter. If
  specified, the `job_name` is assigned to the job, which can also be used
  as a filter in `IBMQBackend.jobs()`. (\#300, \#384)
- `IBMQBackend.run()` now accepts an optional `job_share_level`
  parameter. If specified, the job could be shared with other users at the
  global, hub, group, project, or none level. (\#414)
- The signature of `IBMQBackend.jobs()` is changed. `db_filter`, which was the
  4th parameter, is now the 5th parameter. (\#300)
- The `backend.properties()` function now accepts an optional `datetime`
  parameter. If specified, the function returns the backend properties closest
  to, but older than, the specified datetime filter. (\#277)
- The `WebsocketClient.get_job_status()` method now accepts two optional
  parameters: `retries` and `backoff_factor`. (\#341)
- The `IBMQJob` class has been refactored:
  - The `IBMQJob` attributes are now automatically populated based on the
    information contained in the remote API. As a result, the `IBMQJob`
    constructor signature has changed. (\#329)
  - `IBMQJob.submit()` can no longer be called directly, and jobs are expected
    to be submitted via `IBMQBackend.run()`. (\#329)
  - `IBMQJob.error_message()` now gives more information on why a job failed.
     (\#375)
  - `IBMQJob.queue_position()` now accepts an optional `refresh` parameter that
    indicates whether it should query the API for the latest queue position.
    (\#387)
  - The `IBMQJob.result()` function now accepts an optional `partial` parameter.
    If specified, `IBMQJob.result()` will return partial results for jobs with
    experiments that failed. (\#399)
- The Exception hierarchy has been refined with more specialized classes, and
  exception chaining is used in some cases - please inspect the complete
  traceback for more informative failures. (\#395, \#396)
- Some `warnings` have been toned down to `logger.warning` messages. (\#379)

### Removed

- Support for the legacy Quantum Experience and QConsole is fully deprecated.
  Only credentials from the new Quantum Experience can be used. (\#344)
- The circuits functionality has been temporarily removed from the provider. It
  will be reintroduced in future versions. (\#429)


## [0.3.3] - 2019-09-30

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where proxy parameters were not fully passed to the final
  sessions, leading to incomplete proxy support. (\#353)

## [0.3.2] - 2019-08-20

### Changed

- Pin version of `nest_asyncio` requirement. (\#312)

## [0.3.1] - 2019-07-23

### Changed

- The `backend.jobs()` function now has a default `limit` of 10 results, and
  in the IBM Q Experience v2 will automatically perform several API calls in
  order to retrieve the specified number of jobs, if higher. (\#263)

### Fixed

- `load_accounts` dispatches to `load_account` if v2 credentials are stored,
  allowing for backward compatibility. (\#273)

## [0.3.0] - 2019-07-15

### Fixed

- Fixed Circuits status checks according to latest API changes. (\#95)
- Fixed an authentication issue with the `backend_status` endpoint when using
  the new api. (\#101)

### Changed

- The package defaults to connecting to the IBM Q Experience v2 by default, and
  to using a single token and URL for accessing all the remote capabilities.
  - an `IBMQ.update_account()` added for helping transitioning. (\#209)
  - `qiskit.IBMQ` is no longer a `Provider`: providers for the individual
    projects can be obtained via `IBMQ.get_provider()`. (\#214)
  - the `qiskit.IBMQ` account-management methods have been revised, and act
    on a single account. (\#186)
  - the `qiskit.IBMQ` backend-management methods have been moved to the
    individual `AccountProvider` instances. (\#186, \#212).
- Updated detection of classic vs. new api based on version endpoint. (\#95)
- The `requires_qe_access` decorator, previously in terra, is now included in
  this package. (\#128)
- `IBMQJob.job_id()` now accepts an optional `timeout` parameter, for allowing
  users finer control over the waiting time. (\#238)

### Added

- Added support for pooling job status via websockets. Note this is only
  available when using the new API authentication. (\#100)
- Added support for using object storage when submitting and retrieving
  jobs. Note this is only available when using the new IBM Q Experience
  v2. (\#110)
- Added support for custom qx-client-application request header via the environment
  variable `QE_CUSTOM_CLIENT_APP_HEADER` when using the new IBM Q Experience
  v2. (\#165)
- `backend.properties()` and `backend.defaults()` now accept a `refresh` flag.
  When False, cached data will be returned. (\#224)

### Deprecated

- Support for the legacy IBM Q Experience and Qconsole is on the process of
  being deprecated. They will still be supported during the `0.3.x` versions,
  but we encourage transitioning to the new IBM Q Experience. (\#232)
  - the `IBMQ.load_accounts()` and account-management methods are replaced by
    methods that work on a single token and URL.
  - the `IBMQ.backends()` method has been moved to the provider instances:
    `provider = IBMQ.get_provider(); provider.backends()`.
  - the `IBMQ.get_backend(name)` method has been moved to the provider
    instances: `provider = IBMQ.get_provider(); provider.get_backend(name)`.

  and excluding specific fields from the response. (\#6)
- Added `backend.defauls()` for retrieving the pulse defaults for a backend
  through a new endpoint. (\#33)
- Added `job.properties()` for retrieving the backend properties for a job
  through a new endpoint. (\#35)

### Changed

- The IBMQ Provider has been moved to an individual package outside the Qiskit
  Terra package.
- The exception hierarchy has been revised: the package base exception is
  `IBMQError`, and they have been grouped in `.exception` modules. (\#5)
