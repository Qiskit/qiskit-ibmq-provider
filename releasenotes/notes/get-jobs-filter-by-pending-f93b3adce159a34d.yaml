    An optional boolean parameter `pending` has been added to
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.runtime.IBMRuntimeService.jobs`
    and it allows filtering jobs by their status.
    If `pending` is not specified all jobs are returned.
    If `pending` is set to True, 'QUEUED' and 'RUNNING' jobs are returned.
    If `pending` is set to False, 'DONE', 'ERROR' and 'CANCELLED' jobs are returned.
