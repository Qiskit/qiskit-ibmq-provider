fixes:
  - |
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.jobs` will now return the correct
    list of :class:`~qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob` objects when the
    ``status`` kwarg is set to ``'RUNNING'``.
  - |
    The package metadata has been updated to properly reflect the dependency
    on ``qiskit-terra`` >= 0.14.0. This dependency was implicitly added as
    part of the 0.7.0 release but was not reflected in the package requirements
    so it was previously possible to install ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` with a
    version of ``qiskit-terra`` which was too old. Fixes
    `#677 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/issues/677>`_
