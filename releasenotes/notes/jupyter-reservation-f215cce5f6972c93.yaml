    Two Jupyter magic functions, the IQX dashboard and the backend widget, are
    updated to display backend reservations. If a backend has reservations
    scheduled in the next 24 hours, time to the next one and its duration
    are displayed (e.g. ``Reservation: in 6 hrs 30 min (60m)``). If there is
    a reservation and the backend is active, the backend status is displayed
    as ``active [R]``.
