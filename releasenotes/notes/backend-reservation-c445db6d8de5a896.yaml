    List new features here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend` now has a new
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.reservations` method that
    returns reservation information for the backend, with optional filtering.
    In addition, you can now use
    :meth:`provider.backends.my_reservations()<qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackendService.my_reservations>`
    to query for your own reservations.
