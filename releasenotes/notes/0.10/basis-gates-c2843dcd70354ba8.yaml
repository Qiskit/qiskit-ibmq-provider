upgrade:
    Starting from this release, the `basis_gates` returned by
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.configuration` may differ for
    each backend. You should update your program if it relies on the
    basis gates being ``['id','u1','u2','u3','cx']``. We recommend always
    using the :meth:`~qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.configuration`
    method to find backend configuration values instead of hard coding them.
