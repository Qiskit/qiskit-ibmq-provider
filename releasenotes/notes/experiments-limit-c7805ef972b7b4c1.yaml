    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment.ExperimentService.experiments` and
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment.ExperimentService.analysis_results`
    now support a ``limit`` parameter that allows you to limit the number of
    experiments and analysis results returned.

  - |
    A new parameter, ``limit`` is now the first parameter for both
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment.ExperimentService.experiments` and
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment.ExperimentService.analysis_results`
    methods. This ``limit`` has a default value of 10, meaning by deafult only
    10 experiments and analysis results will be returned.
