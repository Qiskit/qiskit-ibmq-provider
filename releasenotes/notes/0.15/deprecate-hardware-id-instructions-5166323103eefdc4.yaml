deprecations:
  - |
    The ``id`` instruction has been deprecated on IBM hardware
    backends. Instead, please use the ``delay`` instruction which
    implements variable-length delays, specified in units of
    ``dt``. When running a circuit containing an ``id`` instruction,
    a warning will be raised on job submission and any ``id``
    instructions in the job will be automatically replaced with their
    equivalent ``delay`` instruction.
