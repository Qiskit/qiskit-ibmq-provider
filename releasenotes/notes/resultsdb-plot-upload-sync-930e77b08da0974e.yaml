    The methods
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experimentservice.ExperimentService.upload_plot`
    and
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experimentservice.ExperimentService.update_plot`
    now accept the ``sync_upload`` keyword. This controls whether or not the plot
    will be uploaded asynchronously or synchronously to backend storage. By default
    ``sync_upload`` is ``True`` for synchronous upload.
