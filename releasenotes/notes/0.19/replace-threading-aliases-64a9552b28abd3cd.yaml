    ``threading.currentThread`` and ``notifyAll`` were deprecated in Python 3.10 (October 2021)
    and will be removed in Python 3.12 (October 2023).
    PR `#1133 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/pull/1133>`__ replaces them
    with ``threading.current_thread``, ``notify_all`` added in Python 2.6 (October 2008).
