    In the upcoming terra release there will be a release candidate tagged
    prior to the final release. However changing the version string for the
    package is blocked on the qiskit-ibmq-provider right now because it is trying
    to parse the version and is assuming there will be no prelease suffix on
    the version string (see `#8200 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/8200>`__
    for the details). PR `#1135 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/pull/1135>`__
    fixes this version parsing to use the regex from the
    pypa/packaging project which handles all the PEP440 package versioning
    include pre-release suffixes. This will enable terra to release an
    0.21.0rc1 tag without breaking the qiskit-ibmq-provider.
