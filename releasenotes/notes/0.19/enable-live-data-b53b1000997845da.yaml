    The qiskit-ibmq-provider package now supports IBM Quantum LiveData features.
    These features allow users to observe the real-time behavior of IBM Quantum
    backends while executing jobs. Specifically, the provider now includes a
    new tab in the backend Jupyter-related widget and supports the execution of
    jobs (via :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.run` method) with the
    `live_data_enabled=True` parameter in allowed IBM Quantum backends.
