    A new backend configuration attribute ``input_allowed`` now tells you the
    types of input supported by the backend. Valid input types are ``job``, which
    means circuit jobs, and ``runtime``, which means Qiskit Runtime.

    You can also use ``input_allowed`` in backend filtering. For example::

      from qiskit import IBMQ

      provider = IBMQ.load_account()
      # Get a list of all backends that support runtime.
      runtime_backends = provider.backends(input_allowed='runtime')
