fixes:
  - |
    Streaming runtime program interim results with proxies is now supported.
    You can specify the proxies to use when enabling the account as usual,
    for example::

      from qiskit import IBMQ

      proxies = {'urls': {'https://127.0.0.1:8085'}}
      provider = IBMQ.enable_account(API_TOKEN, proxies=proxies)
