    The methods
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment.IBMExperimentService.create_figure`
    and
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment.IBMExperimentService.update_figure`
    now accept the ``sync_upload`` keyword. This controls whether or not the figure
    will be uploaded asynchronously or synchronously to backend storage. By default
    ``sync_upload`` is ``True`` for synchronous upload.
