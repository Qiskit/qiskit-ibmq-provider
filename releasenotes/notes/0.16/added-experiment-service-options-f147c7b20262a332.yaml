    A user can now set and retrieve preferences for
    :class:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment.IBMExperimentService`.
    Preferences are saved on disk in the ``$HOME/.qiskit/qiskitrc`` file.
    Currently the only preference option is ``auto_save``, which tells
    applications that use this service, such as `qiskit-experiments`,
    whether you want changes to be automatically saved.

    Usage examples::

      provider.experiment.save_preferences(auto_save=True) # set and save preferences
      provider.experiment.preferences                      # return all saved preferences
