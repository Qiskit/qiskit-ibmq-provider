    :class:`~qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment.IBMExperimentService` is
    updated to use the new :class:`~qiskit.providers.experiment.ExperimentData`,
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.experiment.AnalysisResult` and
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.experiment.ExperimentService` classes. As a result,
    the syntax of the experiment service is drastically changed. This change,
    however, takes the experiment service out of beta mode, and future changes
    will provide backward compatibility according to Qiskit deprecation policy.
