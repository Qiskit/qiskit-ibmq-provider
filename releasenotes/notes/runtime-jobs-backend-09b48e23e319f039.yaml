    Method :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.runtime.RuntimeJob.backend` can now
    return a string if the provider used to retrive the job is different
    from the provider used to submit the runtime job. The method continues to
    return a :class:`~qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend` instance if the
    providers are the same.

    Fixes the issue wherein a ``QiskitBackendNotFoundError`` exception is raised
    when retrieving a runtime job that was submitted using a different provider
    than the one used for retrival.
