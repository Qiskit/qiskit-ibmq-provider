    You can now access the IBMQ random number services, such as the CQC
    randomness extractor, using the new package
    :mod:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.random`. Note that this feature is still in
    beta, and not all accounts have access to it. It is also subject to heavy
    modification in both functionality and API without backward compatibility.
