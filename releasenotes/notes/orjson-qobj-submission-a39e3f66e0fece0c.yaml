    `orjson <https://github.com/ijl/orjson>`__ is now a dependency for
    installing ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` on x86_64 and arm64/aarch64 systems;
    on other platforms its an optional dependency. Using orjson enables
    significantly faster JSON serialization which improves the performance
    of the provider.
