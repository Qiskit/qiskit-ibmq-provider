    Fixed an issue with JSON encoding and decoding when using
    ``ParameterExpression``\ s in conjunction with Qiskit Terra 0.19.1 and
    above.  Previously, the ``Parameter`` instances reconstructed from the JSON
    output would have different unique identifiers, causing them to seem unequal
    to the input.  They will now have the correct backing identities.
