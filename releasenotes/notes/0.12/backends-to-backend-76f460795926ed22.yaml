deprecations:
  - |
    The ``backends`` attribute of :class:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.AccountProvider`
    has been renamed to ``backend`` (sigular). For backward compatibility, you
    can continue to use ``backends``, but it is deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release. The :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.AccountProvider.backends`
    method remains unchanged. For example::

      backend = provider.backend.ibmq_vigo   # This is the new syntax.
      backend = provider.backends.ibmq_vigo  # This is deprecated.
      backends = provider.backends()         # This continues to work as before.
