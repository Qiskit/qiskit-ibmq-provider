deprecations:
  - |
    "The ``validate_qobj`` keyword in :meth:`qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.run`
    is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    If you're relying on this schema validation you should pull the schemas
    from the `Qiskit/ibmq-schemas <https://github.com/Qiskit/ibm-quantum-schemas>`_
    and directly validate your payloads with that.
