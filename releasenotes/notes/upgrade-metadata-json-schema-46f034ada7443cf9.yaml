  - |
    :meth:`qiskit.provider.ibmq.runtime.IBMRuntimeService.upload_program` now takes only two
    parameters, ``data``, which is the program passed as a string or the path to the program
    file and the ``metadata``, which is passed as a dictionary or path to the metadata JSON file.
    In ``metadata`` the ``backend_requirements``, ``parameters``, ``return_values`` and
    ``interim_results`` are now grouped under a specifications ``spec`` section.
    ``parameters``, ``return_values`` and ``interim_results`` should now be specified as
    JSON Schema.
