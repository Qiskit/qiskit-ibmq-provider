    The :func:`~qiskit.providers.ibmq.least_busy` function now takes a new,
    optional parameter ``reservation_free`` that specifies the number of
    minutes a backend needs not have any reservations to be considered available.
    For example, if the default value of 60 is used, then any
    backends that have reservations in the next 60 minutes are considered unavailable.
