    The :func:`~qiskit.providers.ibmq.least_busy` function now takes a new,
    optional parameter ``reservation_lookahead``. If specified or defaulted to,
    a backend is considered unavailable if it has reservations in the next
    ``n`` minutes, where ``n`` is the value of ``reservation_lookahead``.
    For example, if the default value of 60 is used, then any
    backends that have reservations in the next 60 minutes are considered unavailable.
