class IBMQJob(BaseJob):
    """Represent the jobs that will be executed on IBM-Q simulators and real
    devices. Jobs are intended to be created calling ``run()`` on a particular
    backend.

    Creating a ``Job`` instance does not imply running it. You need to do it in
    separate steps::

        job = IBMQJob(...)
        job.submit() # It won't block.

    An error while submitting a job will cause the next call to ``status()`` to
    raise. If submitting the job successes, you can inspect the job's status by
    using ``status()``. Status can be one of ``JobStatus`` members::

        from qiskit.backends.jobstatus import JobStatus

        job = IBMQJob(...)
        job.submit()

        try:
            job_status = job.status() # It won't block. It will query the backend API.
            if job_status is JobStatus.RUNNING:
                print('The job is still running')

        except JobError as ex:
            print("Something wrong happened!: {}".format(ex))

    A call to ``status()`` can raise if something happens at the API level that
    prevents Qiskit from determining the status of the job. An example of this
    is a temporary connection lose or a network failure.

    The ``submit()`` and ``status()`` methods are examples of non-blocking API.
    ``Job`` instances also have `id()` and ``result()`` methods which will
    block::

        job = IBMQJob(...)
        job.submit()

        try:
            job_id = job.id() # It will block until completing submission.
            print('The job {} was successfully submitted'.format(job_id))

            job_result = job.result() # It will block until finishing.
            print('The job finished with result {}'.format(job_result))

        except JobError as ex:
            print("Something wrong happened!: {}".format(ex))

    Both methods can raise if something ath the API level happens that prevent
    Qiskit from determining the status of the job.

    Note:
        When querying the API for getting the status, two kinds of errors are
        possible. The most severe is the one preventing Qiskit from getting a
        response from the backend. This can be caused by a network failure or a
        temporary system break. In these cases, calling ``status()`` will raise.

        If Qiskit successfully retrieves the status of a job, it could be it
        finished with errors. In that case, ``status()`` will simply return
        ``JobStatus.ERROR`` and you can call ``error_message()`` to get more
        info.
