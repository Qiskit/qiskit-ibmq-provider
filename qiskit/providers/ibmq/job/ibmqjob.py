    """Representation of a job that will be execute on a IBMQ backend.

    Represent a job that is or has been executed on an IBMQ simulator or real
    device. New jobs are intended to be created by calling ``run()`` on a
    particular backend.

    If the job was successfully submitted, you can inspect the job's status by
    using ``status()``. Status can be one of ``JobStatus`` members::

        from qiskit.providers.jobstatus import JobStatus

        job = IBMQBackend.run(...)

        try:
            job_status = job.status() # It will query the backend API.
            if job_status is JobStatus.RUNNING:
                print('The job is still running')

        except IBMQJobApiError as ex:
            print("Something wrong happened!: {}".format(ex))

    A call to ``status()`` can raise if something happens at the server level
    that prevents Qiskit from determining the status of the job. An example of
    this is a temporary connection lose or a network failure.

    The ``status()`` method is an example of non-blocking API.
    The ``result()`` method is an example of blocking API:

        job = IBMQBackend.run(...)

        try:
            job_result = job.result() # It will block until finishing.
            print('The job finished with result {}'.format(job_result))

        except JobError as ex:
            print("Something wrong happened!: {}".format(ex))

    Many of the ``IBMQJob`` methods can raise ``IBMQJobApiError`` if unexpected
    failures happened at the server level.

    Job information retrieved from the API server is attached to the ``IBMQJob``
    instance as attributes. Given that Qiskit and the API server can be updated
    independently, some of these attributes might be deprecated or experimental.
    Supported attributes can be retrieved via methods. For example, you
    can use ``IBMQJob.creation_date()`` to retrieve the job creation date,
    which is a supported attribute.

    Note:
        When querying the server for getting the job information, two kinds
        of errors are possible. The most severe is the one preventing Qiskit
        from getting a response from the server. This can be caused by a
        network failure or a temporary system break. In these cases, the job
         method will raise.

        If Qiskit successfully retrieves the status of a job, it could be it
        finished with errors. In that case, ``status()`` will simply return
        ``JobStatus.ERROR`` and you can call ``error_message()`` to get more
        info.

            The first call to this method in an ``IBMQJob`` instance will query

            job having been consumed.

            When `partial=True`, the result method returns a `Result` object
            containing partial results. If partial results are returned, precaution
            should be taken when accessing individual experiments, as doing so might
            cause an exception. Verifying whether some experiments of a job failed can
            be done by checking the boolean attribute `Result.success`.
