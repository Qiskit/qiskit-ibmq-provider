IBM Quantum Provider (:mod:`qiskit.providers.ibmq`)
===================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.providers.ibmq

Modules representing the IBM Quantum Provider.

Logging
=====================

The IBM Quantum Provider uses the ``qiskit.providers.ibmq`` logger.

Two environment variables can be used to control the logging:

    * ``QISKIT_IBMQ_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL``: Specifies the log level to use, for the
      ibmq-provider modules. If an invalid level is set, the log level defaults to ``WARNING``.
      The valid log levels are ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, and ``CRITICAL``
      (case-insensitive). If the environment variable is not set, then the parent logger's level
      is used, which also defaults to ``WARNING``.
    * ``QISKIT_IBMQ_PROVIDER_LOG_FILE``: Specifies the name of the log file to use. If specified,
      messages will be logged to the file only. Otherwise messages will be logged to the standard
      error (usually the screen).

For more advanced use, you can modify the logger itself. For example, to manually set the level
to ``WARNING``::

    import logging
    logging.getLogger('qiskit.providers.ibmq').setLevel(logging.WARNING)
