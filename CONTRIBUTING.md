Contributing Qiskit IBMQ Provider
---------------------------

You can contribute in many ways to this project.

### Issue reporting

This is a good point to start, when you find a problem please add it to
the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/issues). The
ideal report should include the steps to reproduce it.

### Doubts solving

To help less advanced users is another wonderful way to start. You can
help us close some opened issues. This kind of tickets should be labeled
as `question`.

### Improvement proposal

If you have an idea for a new feature please open a ticket labeled as
`enhancement`. If you could also add a piece of code with the idea or a
partial implementation it would be awesome.

### Contributor License Agreement

We\'d love to accept your code! Before we can, we have to get a few
legal requirements sorted out. By signing a contributor license
agreement (CLA), we ensure that the community is free to use your
contributions.

When you contribute to the project with a new pull request, a bot will
evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the bot will
comment on the pull request, including a link to accept the agreement.
The [individual CLA](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-cla.pdf) document
is available for review as a PDF.

**Note:**
> If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute
> your work, then you will need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-corporate-cla.pdf) 
> and email it to us at <qiskit@us.ibm.com>.

### Good first contributions

You are welcome to contribute wherever in the code you want to, of
course, but we recommend taking a look at the 
[`good first contribution`
](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+) 
label into the issues and pick one. We would love to mentor you!

### Documentation

Review the parts of the documentation regarding the new changes and
update it if it\'s needed.

### Pull requests

We use [GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) 
to accept the contributions.

A friendly reminder! We\'d love to have a previous discussion about the
best way to implement the feature/bug you are contributing with. This is
a good way to improve code quality in our beloved Qiskit!, so remember
to file a new Issue before starting to code for a solution.

So after having discussed the best way to land your changes into the
codebase, you are ready to start coding (yay!). We have two options
here:

1.  You think your implementation doesn\'t introduce a lot of code,
    right?. Ok, no problem, you are all set to create the PR once you
    have finished coding. We are waiting for it!
2.  Your implementation does introduce many things in the codebase. That
    sounds great! Thanks!. In this case you can start coding and create
    a PR with the word: **\[WIP\]** as a prefix of the description. This
    means \"Work In Progress\", and allow reviewers to make micro
    reviews from time to time without waiting for the big and final
    solution\... otherwise, it would make reviewing and coming changes
    pretty difficult to accomplish. The reviewer will remove the
    **\[WIP\]** prefix from the description once the PR is ready to
    merge.

#### Pull request checklist

When submitting a pull request and you feel it is ready for review,
please double check that:

-   the code follows the code style of the project. For convenience, you
    can execute `make style` and `make lint` locally, which will print
    potential style warnings and fixes.
-   the documentation has been updated accordingly. In particular, if a
    function or class has been modified during the PR, please update the
    docstring accordingly.
-   your contribution passes the existing tests, and if developing a new
    feature, that you have added new tests that cover those changes.
-   you add a new line to the `CHANGELOG.rst` file, in the `UNRELEASED`
    section, with the title of your pull request and its identifier (for
    example, \"`Replace OldComponent with FluxCapacitor (#123)`\".

#### Commit messages

Please follow the next rules for the commit messages:

-   It should include a reference to the issue ID in the first line of
    the commit, **and** a brief description of the issue, so everybody
    knows what this ID actually refers to without wasting to much time
    on following the link to the issue.
-   It should provide enough information for a reviewer to understand
    the changes and their relation to the rest of the code.

A good example:

``` {.text}
Issue #190: Short summary of the issue
* One of the important changes
* Another important change
```

Code
----

This section include some tips that will help you to push source code.

**Note:**
> We recommend using a self-contained environment, 
> such as [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) 
> or [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)
> environments, to cleanly separate Qiskit from other applications 
> and improve your experience.

### Setup with Conda virtual environment

Issue the following command to create and activate the virtual environment:

``` {.sh}
$ conda create -y -n QiskitDevenv python=3
$ conda activate QiskitDevenv
```

### Setup with Python virtual environment

Issue the following command to create a virtual environment:

```{.sh}
$ python -m venv QiskitDevenv
```

#### Linux and Mac

Issue the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```{.sh}
$ source QiskitDevenv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

Issue the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```{.sh}
$ QiskitDevenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

For the python code, we need some libraries that can be installed in
this way:

``` {.sh}
$ cd qiskit-ibmq-provider
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Test

New features often imply changes in the existent tests or new ones are
needed. Once they\'re updated/added run this be sure they keep passing.

For executing the tests, a `make test` target is available.

For executing a simple python test manually, you can just run this
command:

Linux and Mac:

``` {.bash}
$ LOG_LEVEL=INFO python -m unittest test/test_something.py
```

Windows:

``` {.bash}
C:\..\> python -m unittest test/test_something.py
```

Note many of the tests will not be executed unless you have setup an
IBMQ account. To set this up please go to this
[page](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login) and
register an account.

By default, and if there is no user credentials available, the tests
that require online access are run with recorded (mocked) information.
This is, the remote requests are replayed from a `test/cassettes` and
not real HTTP requests is generated. If user credentials are found, in
that cases it use them to make the network requests.

How and which tests are executed is controlled by a environment variable
`QISKIT_TESTS`. The options are (where `uc_available = True` if the user
credentials are available, and `False` otherwise):

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Option          Description                             Default              If `True`, forces
  --------------- --------------------------------------- -------------------- -----------------------
  `skip_online`   Skips tests that require remote         `False`              `rec = False`
                  requests (also, no mocked information                        
                  is used). Does not require user                              
                  credentials.                                                 

  `mock_online`   It runs the online tests using mocked   `not uc_available`   `skip_online = False`
                  information. Does not require user                           
                  credentials.                                                 

  `run_slow`      It runs tests tagged as *slow*.         `False`              

  `rec`           It records the remote requests. It      `False`              `skip_online = False`
                  requires user credentials.                                   `run_slow = False`
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to provide more than one option separated with commas.
The order of precedence in the options is right to left. For example,
`QISKIT_TESTS=skip_online,rec` will set the options as
`skip_online == False` and `rec == True`.

### Style guide

Please submit clean code and please make effort to follow existing
conventions in order to keep it as readable as possible. We use:
* [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) linter
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) style
* [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) type hinting

To ensure your changes respect the style guidelines, you can run the following
commands:

All platforms:

``` {.sh}
$> cd out
out$> make lint
out$> make style
out$> make mypy
```

Development cycle
-----------------

Our development cycle is straightforward, we define a roadmap with
milestones for releases, and features that we want to include in these
releases. The roadmap is not public at the moment, but it\'s a committed
project in our community and we are working to make parts of it public
in a way that can be beneficial for everyone. Whenever a new release is
close to be launched, we\'ll announce it and detail what has changed
since the latest version. The channels we\'ll use to announce new
releases are still being discussed, but for now you can [follow
us](https://twitter.com/qiskit) on Twitter!

### Branch model

There are two main branches in the repository:

-   `master`
    -   This is the development branch.
    -   Next release is going to be developed here. For example, if the
        current latest release version is r1.0.3, the master branch
        version will point to r1.1.0 (or r2.0.0).
    -   You should expect this branch to be updated very frequently.
    -   Even though we are always doing our best to not push code that
        breaks things, is more likely to eventually push code that
        breaks something\... we will fix it ASAP, promise :).
    -   This should not be considered as a stable branch to use in
        production environments.
    -   The API of Qiskit could change without prior notice.
-   `stable`
    -   This is our stable release branch.
    -   It\'s always synchronized with the latest distributed package,
        as for now, the package you can download from pip.
    -   The code in this branch is well tested and should be free of
        errors (unfortunately sometimes it\'s not).
    -   This is a stable branch (as the name suggest), meaning that you
        can expect stable software ready for production environments.
    -   All the tags from the release versions are created from this
        branch.

### Release cycle

From time to time, we will release brand new versions of the package.
These are well-tested versions of the software.

When the time for a new release has come, we will:

1.  Merge the `master` branch with the `stable` branch.
2.  Create a new tag with the version number in the `stable` branch.
3.  Crate and distribute the pip package.
4.  Change the `master` version to the next release version.
5.  Announce the new version to the world!

The `stable` branch should only receive changes in the form of bug
fixes, so the third version number (the maintenance number:
\[major\].\[minor\].\[maintenance\]) will increase on every new change.
